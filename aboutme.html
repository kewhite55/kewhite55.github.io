<h3>Hello hobbyist and future hobbyist! My name is Khrystina White, 
	  and I am the creator and author of this website. I am twenty-eight years old, and I work as a middle 
	  school teacher, but I will soon be transitioning into a new career soon! I am from Whiteville, North 
	  Carolina, born and raised! I went to a small Christian school in Murfreesboro, NC for four years of college
	  and four years of division two softball! I graduated in 2017 and went on to obtain a masterâ€™s in 2021. 
	  After Graduating in 2017 I felt a void like most athletes do once their sport has just run its course. I 
	  quickly realized I could transition over to slow-pitch softball and fill that void of my childhood sport. I 
	  have been playing ever since and has truly been my haven. I truly hope to help you find your thing, boost
	  your morale, fill your voids, and truly help you find something you love to do! Something for you!
</h3>
